A proposal for data standardization in neurophysiology

The need for data standardization in neuroscience is well understood. While substantial efforts have been put into developing neurodata file standards, widespread adoption of these standards has still not occurred. A similar dynamic has occurred previously in other fields. Here we propose a simple model for data standardization in neurophysiology, based on lessons learned by the [open microscopy environment](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/).
